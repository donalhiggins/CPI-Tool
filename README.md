# Classification Tool
 A GUI tool for the CPI form. 
 
 Start:
 Asks for the name of the utility that you are testing and when you press start goes to the first question of the CPI and runs through the entire thing.

 Buttons:
 The flag button allows you to add a comment to a question. It creates a window that has an entry box and two buttons, skip and ok. The skip button collects your comment and adds it to the end report and moves the rest of the CPI Map to the end of the form. The ok button collects your comment and allows you to continue the form on the question that you are currently on.

 Critical:
 When you hit a critical the program will prompt you to enter why you believe it was critical. This will be stored and entered into the report it generates.

 Report:
 At the end of the CPI tool a window will pop up and contain the infomation that the CPI tool collected, criticals and flags. This report will also be saved in a text document with the name of the utility you are testing in the 'Reports' folder.
